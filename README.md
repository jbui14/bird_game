# 🐦 Bird Game Clone

A Flappy Bird-inspired 2D side-scrolling game built with Python and Pygame. This project demonstrates fundamentals of game development, including sprite animation, physics-based movement, collision detection, and object-oriented design.

## 🚀 Features

- 🐤 Smooth 8-frame bird sprite animation  
- 🎯 Physics-based flapping and tilt mechanics  
- 🧱 Collision detection with ground and screen boundaries  
- 🌆 Scrolling background for side-scrolling effect  
- ⌨️ Simple and intuitive controls  
- 🔧 Modular code structure for scalability  

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pygame** – for rendering, event handling, and game loop management
